# Changelog

All notable changes to the Agenda Bot project will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.5] - 2025-09-12

### üîß Enhanced - Bot Identity & User Experience
- **Unified bot naming**: Simplified bot names from "Agenda bot" to "Agenda" (English) and "Tagesordnung" (German)

- **Better attention-grabbing**: Makes agenda summaries easier to spot in chat conversations

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed - Reaction-Based Cleanup
- **Reaction-based cleanup false positives**: Fixed overly broad cleanup detection that incorrectly triggered on unrelated messages
- **Removed problematic fallback logic**: Eliminated fallback that caused cleanup to trigger when reacting with üëç to any message containing "agenda" or "summary"
