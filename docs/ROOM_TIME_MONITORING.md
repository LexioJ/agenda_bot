# Room-Level Time Monitoring

This document describes the room-level time monitoring feature in Agenda Bot v1.2.0, which allows per-room configuration of time tracking settings while maintaining backward compatibility with global settings.

## Overview

Room-level time monitoring enables different Talk rooms to have their own time tracking configurations, overriding the global defaults when needed. This is particularly useful for organizations with different meeting types that require different time management approaches.

### Key Features

- **Room-specific configuration**: Each Talk room can have its own time monitoring settings
- **Global fallback**: Rooms without specific configuration use global defaults
- **Moderator control**: Room moderators and owners can configure time monitoring for their rooms
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing deployments continue working with global settings
- **Dynamic enabling/disabling**: Time monitoring can be enabled or disabled per room
- **Custom thresholds**: Warning and overtime thresholds can be set per room

## Architecture

### Components

1. **RoomConfigService**: Manages room-specific configuration storage and retrieval
2. **AgendaService**: Enhanced with room-aware time monitoring methods
3. **TimeMonitorService**: Updated to use room-specific settings with global fallback
4. **BotInvokeListener**: Routes new time monitoring commands
5. **CommandParser**: Parses new room-level time monitoring commands

### Database Schema

Room configurations are stored as entries in the existing `oc_ab_log_entries` table using the `room_config` entry type:

```sql
-- No new table needed! Uses existing structure:
-- oc_ab_log_entries with type='room_config'
-- Configuration stored as JSON in the details field
```

**Smart Design Benefits:**
- âœ¨ **Zero schema changes** - Uses existing table structure
- ðŸš€ **Instant deployment** - No migrations required
- ðŸ”„ **Backward compatible** - Existing setups unaffected
- âš¡ **Efficient queries** - Existing indexes support the pattern

## User Interface

### Available Commands

#### View Configuration
```
time config
```
Shows current time monitoring configuration for the room, indicating whether it's using global defaults or room-specific settings.

#### Enable/Disable Monitoring
```
time enable
time disable
```
Enables or disables time monitoring for the specific room.

#### Set Warning Threshold
```
time warning 75
```
Sets the first warning threshold to 75% of planned time for the room.

#### Set Overtime Threshold
```
time overtime 110
```
Sets the overtime alert threshold to 110% of planned time for the room.

#### Set Both Thresholds
```
time thresholds 80 120
```
Sets both warning (80%) and overtime (120%) thresholds in one command.

#### Reset to Global Defaults
```
time reset
```
Removes room-specific configuration, causing the room to fall back to global defaults.

### Permission Requirements

All room-level time monitoring commands require **moderator or owner** permissions in the Talk room.

## Configuration Examples

### Global Default Configuration
```
time config
```
Response:
```
ðŸ•’ Time Monitoring (Global Default)
â€¢ Status: âœ… Enabled
â€¢ First warning at 80%
â€¢ Overtime alert at 120%
â€¢ Configured globally by admin
â€¢ Time checks run every 5 minutes with Nextcloud's background jobs
```

### Room-Specific Configuration
```
time config
```
Response:
```
ðŸ•’ Room Time Monitoring
â€¢ Status: âœ… Enabled
â€¢ First warning at 60%
â€¢ Overtime alert at 110%
â€¢ Configured by: john.doe on 2025-01-01 15:30
â€¢ Moderators/Owners can configure room-specific time monitoring
```

### Setting Custom Thresholds
```
time thresholds 70 110
```
Response:
```
âœ… Thresholds updated: warning at 70%, overtime at 110%
```

## Technical Implementation

### Configuration Storage

Room configurations are stored as JSON-encoded values with the following keys:

- `time_monitoring`: Contains the complete time monitoring configuration
  ```json
  {
    "enabled": true,
    "warning_threshold": 0.8,
    "overtime_threshold": 1.2,
    "configured_by": "user_id",
    "configured_at": 1640995200
  }
  ```

### Service Integration

#### RoomConfigService Methods

```php
// Get room config with global fallback
public function getRoomConfigWithFallback(string $token): array

// Set room-specific configuration
public function setRoomConfig(string $token, string $key, array $value, ?string $userId = null): bool

// Check if room has specific configuration
public function hasRoomConfig(string $token, string $key): bool

// Reset room configuration (remove override)
public function resetRoomConfig(string $token, ?string $key = null): bool

// Get configuration metadata
public function getRoomConfigMetadata(string $token, string $key): ?array
```

#### AgendaService Enhancements

```php
// Get time monitoring status (room-aware)
public function getTimeMonitoringStatus(string $token, string $lang = 'en'): string

// Set time monitoring config for room
public function setTimeMonitoringConfig(array $config, string $token, ?array $actorData = null, string $lang = 'en'): array
```

#### TimeMonitorService Integration

```php
// Check if time monitoring is enabled for specific room
public function isTimeMonitoringEnabledForRoom(string $token): bool

// Get rooms that have monitoring enabled (filters out disabled rooms)
public function getRoomsForTimeMonitoring(): array

// Check time warnings with room-specific thresholds
public function checkTimeWarnings(string $token, string $lang = 'en'): array
```

### Background Job Updates

The `AgendaTimeMonitorJob` now filters rooms based on their individual monitoring settings:

```php
protected function run($argument): void {
    $rooms = $this->timeMonitorService->getRoomsForTimeMonitoring();
    foreach ($rooms as $token) {
        $this->timeMonitorService->checkTimeWarnings($token);
    }
}
```

### Meeting State Management (Enhanced in v1.2.0)

The room-level time monitoring now includes improved meeting state management:

- **Call start behavior**: When a call starts, the first incomplete agenda item is automatically set as current
- **Call end behavior**: When a call ends, all current agenda items are deactivated (no longer "current")
- **State persistence**: Agenda items remain with their completion status, but no item shows as "current" after meeting ends
- **Clean transitions**: Ensures logical meeting flow with proper state transitions

This ensures that time monitoring only applies during active meetings and that agenda state reflects real-world meeting status.

## Migration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility

1. **Existing installations**: Continue working with global settings
2. **Zero database changes**: Uses existing table structure with new entry type
3. **Global settings preserved**: All existing global time monitoring settings remain unchanged
4. **Gradual adoption**: Rooms can opt into room-specific settings as needed

### Migration Path

1. **Phase 1**: Deploy room-level monitoring code (backward compatible)
2. **Phase 2**: Create room configurations as needed using bot commands
3. **Phase 3**: Optionally migrate global settings to room-specific where appropriate

### Data Migration Script

If needed, a migration script can convert global settings to room-specific:

```php
// Example migration for active rooms
$activeRooms = $this->logEntryMapper->findActiveConversationTokens();
$globalConfig = [
    'enabled' => $this->config->getAppValue('agenda_bot', 'time-monitoring-enabled', 'true') === 'true',
    'warning_threshold' => (float) $this->config->getAppValue('agenda_bot', 'warning-threshold-80', '0.8'),
    'overtime_threshold' => (float) $this->config->getAppValue('agenda_bot', 'overtime-warning-threshold', '1.2')
];

foreach ($activeRooms as $token) {
    $this->roomConfigService->setRoomConfig($token, 'time_monitoring', $globalConfig, 'migration');
}
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Comprehensive unit tests cover:

1. **RoomConfigService**: CRUD operations, validation, fallback logic
2. **AgendaService**: Room-aware configuration methods and permission checks
3. **TimeMonitorService**: Room-specific warning logic and filtering

### Test Files

- `tests/Unit/Service/RoomConfigServiceTest.php`
- `tests/Unit/Service/AgendaServiceRoomConfigTest.php`
- `tests/Unit/Service/TimeMonitorServiceRoomConfigTest.php`

### Running Tests

```bash
# From Nextcloud root
./vendor/bin/phpunit apps/agenda_bot/tests/

# Or using the provided script
bash apps/agenda_bot/run_tests.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Room config not taking effect**
   - Verify moderator permissions
   - Check if background jobs are running
   - Confirm room has active agenda items

2. **Global settings ignored**
   - Check if room has specific configuration overriding global
   - Use `time reset` to remove room overrides

3. **Warnings not sent**
   - Verify time monitoring is enabled for the room
   - Check background job status
   - Ensure agenda item has planned duration

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check room configuration directly
sudo -u apache /var/www/nextcloud/occ config:app:get agenda_bot room-config-TOKEN

# Verify background job status
sudo -u apache /var/www/nextcloud/occ background:queue:status

# Check application logs
tail -f /var/www/nextcloud/data/nextcloud.log | grep agenda_bot
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Permission Enforcement**: All configuration commands require moderator/owner permissions
2. **Data Validation**: All input values are validated and sanitized
3. **Audit Trail**: Configuration changes are logged with user and timestamp
4. **Isolation**: Room configurations are isolated and cannot affect other rooms

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal overhead**: Room configurations are cached and only loaded when needed
- **Efficient filtering**: Background job filters rooms before processing
- **Database optimization**: Indexed queries for fast configuration retrieval
- **Memory usage**: Configuration objects are lightweight and JSON-encoded

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Room templates**: Predefined configuration templates for common meeting types
2. **Bulk configuration**: Admin tools to configure multiple rooms
3. **Advanced scheduling**: Time-based configuration changes
4. **Integration with Calendar**: Sync with Nextcloud Calendar for time estimates
5. **Analytics**: Room-specific time monitoring reports

### API Extensions

Future versions may include REST API endpoints for programmatic configuration management.
